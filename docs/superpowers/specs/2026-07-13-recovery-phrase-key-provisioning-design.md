# Design — Recovery-phrase key provisioning (Sync, Plan 3)

Date: 2026-07-13
Status: proposed (pending review)

## Goal

Replace the base64 sync-key entry in the Sync settings screen with a **BIP39
recovery phrase**: 24 human-readable words that encode the 256-bit `RawSyncKey`,
with a checksum that catches typos. This makes moving the key between a user's
devices legible and error-resistant, across macOS ↔ Android ↔ Linux, with no
camera and no heavy new dependencies.

### Non-goals (deferred to a future Plan 4)

QR-code display and camera scanning. Those add an Android camera stack (CameraX
+ a barcode library), a runtime camera permission, and a scanner screen, and
only ever flow one way (desktop has no camera). The recovery phrase works
everywhere and is the cross-platform core; QR is a later convenience layered on
top of the same key.

## Scope

Replace, in `SyncSettingsScreen` + its `App.kt` wiring:
- **Generate** — today: `RawSyncKey.generate()` → base64 shown in a
  `SelectionContainer`. New: the same key rendered as 24 numbered words.
- **Enter** — today: a paste field decoding base64. New: a phrase field where the
  user types the 24 words (space/newline-separated), validated by checksum.

Everything else stays: the key still lands in `SecureKeyStore` unchanged; the
transport, engine, codec, config, and triggers are untouched.

## Architecture

One pure, testable unit plus a bundled asset and a UI swap.

### Components

- **`RecoveryPhrase`** (`sync/RecoveryPhrase.kt`) — pure object, no I/O.
  - `encode(key: RawSyncKey): List<String>` — the standard BIP39 encoding of
    256-bit entropy: append an 8-bit checksum (first byte of `SHA-256(entropy)`),
    split the resulting 264 bits into 24 groups of 11 bits, map each group
    (0–2047) to a wordlist entry.
  - `decode(words: List<String>): RawSyncKey?` — inverse; returns `null` when
    the word count is not 24, any word is not in the list, or the checksum does
    not match. Case-insensitive, trims/collapses whitespace before matching.
- **`Bip39Wordlist`** — the official 2048-word English list, bundled (a generated
  Kotlin `List<String>` or a resource read once). Chosen for low visual/spelling
  ambiguity; using the standard list avoids bikeshedding and gives interop.
- **`SyncSettingsScreen`** — replace the base64 display with a numbered 24-word
  block (still inside a `SelectionContainer` so it can be copied), and the paste
  field with a phrase input showing an inline "invalid recovery phrase" message
  when `decode` returns `null`.
- **`App.kt`** — `generateSyncKey` returns the phrase text (`encode(...)` joined
  by spaces); `pasteSyncKey`/enter decodes via `RecoveryPhrase.decode`, stores
  the key on success, signals the error on `null`.

## Data flow

1. **Provision on device A:** user taps Generate → `RawSyncKey.generate()` →
   `RecoveryPhrase.encode` → 24 numbered words shown → stored in
   `SecureKeyStore` (as today).
2. **Enter on device B:** user types the 24 words → `RecoveryPhrase.decode` →
   on success, the resulting `RawSyncKey` is stored in `SecureKeyStore`; sync can
   now run. On failure, nothing is stored.

## Error handling

- `decode` is total: any malformed input (wrong count, unknown word, bad
  checksum) yields `null` — never throws. The screen shows an inline error and
  does not store a key; sync status is untouched.
- A wrong-but-valid phrase (correct checksum, wrong key) is indistinguishable at
  entry time — it surfaces later as `SyncStatus.KeyError` on the first sync
  (decrypt fails), which the existing UI already reports. No new handling needed.

## Testing

`RecoveryPhrase` is pure and gets the bulk of the tests (`commonTest`):
- **Round-trip:** `decode(encode(key)) == key` for several random keys.
- **Standard vector:** all-zero 32-byte entropy encodes to the canonical BIP39
  phrase (`"abandon" × 23 + "art"`), proving the encoding matches the standard.
- **Checksum:** swapping one word for another valid word makes `decode` return
  `null`.
- **Unknown word / wrong count:** both return `null`.
- **Whitespace/case tolerance:** extra spaces, newlines, and mixed case decode
  correctly.
- **Wordlist integrity:** exactly 2048 words, unique, lowercase.

UI: a tag-based `SyncSettingsScreen` test (per the repo guardrail — no
`stringResource` assertions) that entering a valid phrase invokes the store
callback and an invalid one surfaces the error tag without storing.

## Open decision

None. Word count (24), scheme (BIP39), and directionality (phrase typed on the
receiving device) are all settled by the 256-bit key size and the phrase-first
scope.
